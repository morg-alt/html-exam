    <h3 class="C">The First Handheld Mobile Telephone is Created and Called From</h3>
        <ul>In the years prior to 1973, mobile telephones were limited to phones installed in cars, trucks, and other vehicles. This all changes when Motorola produced the first handheld mobile phone. The first handheld mobile telephone call was made by Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, on April 3, 1973. The call was placed to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, Martin Cooper's rival. The handheld mobile phone used by Martin Cooper weighed 1.1 Kilograms, measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimeters. The phone took ten full hours to recharge, and offered just 30 minutes of talk time. On September 21st, 1983, Motorola produced the world's first commercial cell phone. It cost each customer $3,995 at the time ($9,831 now) and was called the DynaTAC. Motorola also offered multiple accessories for the DybaTAC. They developed a charger for the DynaTAC that allowed it to charge in one hour. When using the charger, users noticed that the battery would get quite hot when charging at this rate. The charger could also cause major problems for the battery. It would occasionally short circuit the battery, rendering it useless. The battery would wear out often, meaning DynaTAC users would have to replace the battery. Motorola also offered a brass swivel antenna accessory. Lastly, Motorola offered a snug-fitting leather case with a zipper. The case covered the entire body of the large phone, and had a clear plastic front to make the user interface accessible.</ul>
