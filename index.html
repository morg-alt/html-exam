        <h3>Development of MOSFET and Other Technologies</h3>
            <ul>MOSFET, or metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor, was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and is the basic building block of modern mobile phones. Developments in MOSFET power electric technology also enabled the development of digital wireless mobile networks. The lithium-ion battery became indispensable as a source for power for mobile phones. The lithium-ion battery was invented by Rachid Yazami, Akira Yoshino, and John Goodenough in the 1980s. The lithium ion battery was commercialized by Sony and Asahi Kasei in 1991. A part of MOSFET, the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS), and large-scale integration (LSI), information theory, and cellular networking each led to the further development of affordable mobile communications. Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. Digital signals processed this way were a sequence of numbers that represented samples and continuous variables in domains such as space, time, frequency, or wavelet. Digital Sigal Processing is a subfield of signal processing, and can be used to process speech, audio, sonar, radar, and other kinds of sensor arrays. Digital Signal Processing was mainly used on general-purpose computers and digital signal processors, but was used to further advance the development of the mobile phone.</ul>
        <h3>Cellular Concept</h3>
            <ul>Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, who were engineers at Bell Labs, suggested hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles. These cells were going to be part of a communication network where the last link was wireless. The network would be distributed over land in hexagonal cells which would each house one fixed-location tranciever, which would then provide the cell with network coverage. With all these cells combined, they could provide redio coverage throught the land. Unfortunately, at this time, the technology did not exist for this to be able to happen. In two decades, Richard H. Frekiel, Joel S Engel, and Philip T. Porter would expand on the earlier proposals in a much more detailed system plan. Porter was the one who first proposed that directional antennas would be used in cell towers to reduce interference and increase channel reuse. In this idea, there would be no continuity of service if you happened to move thtough several different cells, consumers would have to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the call. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff were described in the late 1960s. In 1970, Amos E. Joel thought up a three-sided trunk circuit to aid in the handoff of calls. His patent had an early Bell Labs cellular concept, but it soon became unnecessary and was never fully implemented in a system. A plan for switching a cellular telephone was invented by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973.</ul>
        <h3>The First Handheld Mobile Telephone is Created and Called From</h3>
            <ul>In the years prior ro 1973, mobile telephones were limited to phones installed in cars, trucks, and other vehicles. This all changes when Motorola produced the first handheld mobile phone. The first handheld mobile telephone call was made by Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, on April 3, 1973. The call was placed to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, Martin Cooper's rival. The handheld mobile phone used by Martin Cooper weighed 1.1 Kilograms, measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimeters. The phone took ten full hours to recharge, and offered just 30 minutes of talk time. On September 21st, 1983, Motorola produced the world's first commercial cell phone. It cost each customer $3,995 at the time ($9,831 now) and was called the DynaTAC. </ul>
