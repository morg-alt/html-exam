        <h3>Development of MOSFET and Other Technologies</h3>
            <ul>MOSFET, or metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor, was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and is the basic building block of modern mobile phones. Developments in MOSFET power electric technology also enabled the development of digital wireless mobile networks. The lithium-ion battery became indispensable as a source for power for mobile phones. The lithium-ion battery was invented by Rachid Yazami, Akira Yoshino, and John Goodenough in the 1980s. The lithium ion battery was commercialized by Sony and Asahi Kasei in 1991. A part of MOSFET, the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS), and large-scale integration (LSI), information theory, and cellular networking each led to the further development of affordable mobile communications. Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. Digital signals processed this way were a sequence of numbers that represented samples and continuous variables in domains such as space, time, frequency, or wavelet. Digital Sigal Processing is a subfield of signal processing, and can be used to process speech, audio, sonar, radar, and other kinds of sensor arrays.</ul>
