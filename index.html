        <h3 class="A">Development of MOSFET and Other Technologies</h3>
            <ul>MOSFET, or metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor, was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and is the basic building block of modern mobile phones. Developments in MOSFET power electric technology also enabled the development of digital wireless mobile networks. The lithium-ion battery became indispensable as a source for power for mobile phones. The lithium-ion battery was invented by Rachid Yazami, Akira Yoshino, and John Goodenough in the 1980s. The lithium ion battery was commercialized by Sony and Asahi Kasei in 1991. A part of MOSFET, the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS), and large-scale integration (LSI), information theory, and cellular networking each led to the further development of affordable mobile communications. Digital signal processing (DSP) is the use of digital processing to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. Digital signals processed this way were a sequence of numbers that represented samples and continuous variables in domains such as space, time, frequency, or wavelet. Digital Sigal Processing is a subfield of signal processing, and can be used to process speech, audio, sonar, radar, and other kinds of sensor arrays. Digital Signal Processing was mainly used on general-purpose computers and digital signal processors, but was used to further advance the development of the mobile phone.</ul>

        <h3 class="B">Cellular Concept</h3>
            <ul>Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, who were engineers at Bell Labs, suggested hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles. These cells were going to be part of a communication network where the last link was wireless. The network would be distributed over land in hexagonal cells which would each house one fixed-location tranciever, which would then provide the cell with network coverage. With all these cells combined, they could provide redio coverage throught the land. Unfortunately, at this time, the technology did not exist for this to be able to happen. In two decades, Richard H. Frekiel, Joel S Engel, and Philip T. Porter would expand on the earlier proposals in a much more detailed system plan. Porter was the one who first proposed that directional antennas would be used in cell towers to reduce interference and increase channel reuse. In this idea, there would be no continuity of service if you happened to move thtough several different cells, consumers would have to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the call. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff were described in the late 1960s. In 1970, Amos E. Joel thought up a three-sided trunk circuit to aid in the handoff of calls. His patent had an early Bell Labs cellular concept, but it soon became unnecessary and was never fully implemented in a system. A plan for switching a cellular telephone was invented by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973.</ul>

        <h3 class="C">The First Handheld Mobile Telephone is Created and Called From</h3>
            <ul>In the years prior to 1973, mobile telephones were limited to phones installed in cars, trucks, and other vehicles. This all changes when Motorola produced the first handheld mobile phone. The first handheld mobile telephone call was made by Martin Cooper, a Motorola researcher and executive, on April 3, 1973. The call was placed to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs, Martin Cooper's rival. The handheld mobile phone used by Martin Cooper weighed 1.1 Kilograms, measured 23 by 13 by 4.5 centimeters. The phone took ten full hours to recharge, and offered just 30 minutes of talk time. On September 21st, 1983, Motorola produced the world's first commercial cell phone. It cost each customer $3,995 at the time ($9,831 now) and was called the DynaTAC. Motorola also offered multiple accessories for the DybaTAC. They developed a charger for the DynaTAC that allowed it to charge in one hour. When using the charger, users noticed that the battery would get quite hot when charging at this rate. The charger could also cause major problems for the battery. It would occasionally short circuit the battery, rendering it useless. The battery would wear out often, meaning DynaTAC users would have to replace the battery. Motorola also offered a brass swivel antenna accessory. Lastly, Motorola offered a snug-fitting leather case with a zipper. The case covered the entire body of the large phone, and had a clear plastic front to make the user interface accessible.</ul>

        <h3 class="D">The First Smartphone</h3>
            <ul>Handheld mobile phones were becoming more common, and peple were quite happy being able to make calls while on the move. In August 1994, International Buisness Machines (IBM) began distributing the IBM Simon Personal Communicator, known by most as the IBM Simon, which was the world's first smartphone. Advances in MOSFET allowed smaller integrated circuit chips, which then allowed smaller mobile phones to be developed. IBM then decided to combine a handheld mobile phone, and a PDA to create a prototype device that allowed a user to make and recieve phone calls, facsmiles, emails, and cellular pages. The prototype also had some features like a calendar, address book and notepad, maps, and stock and news software. A PDA, or Personal Digital Assistant, was a handheld device that functioned as a personal information manager. The first PDA was released in 1984 by Psion, a tech company focused on creating handheld computers. Other tech companies soon followed Psion in creating handheld computers. Soon after IBM developed their prototype, they began work on a project cond named "Angler" which integrated features from Mitsubisi Electric's wireless PDA and cellular radio technologies. When this product was finished, BellSouth executives named the device the Simon Personal Communicator. On August 16th, 1994 BellSouth released the device to consumers. With a price tag of $899 and a 15 state coverage contract, the IBM Simon sold roughly 50,000 units in a six month period.</ul>

        <h3 class="E">4G/5G Networks and Modern Phones</h3>
            <ul>With the advencement of handheld mobile phones came the advancement of phone networks 4G Native Ip networks are currently the mose widely used, but 5G networks are gradually becomming more commonplace. 4G networks were faster than 3G networks by nearly ten times. 4G networks treat voice calls like any other type of media, using packet switching through the internet. The first two commercially available 4G networks were the WiMAX standars, offered by Sprint, and the LTE standard, which was offered by TellaSonera in Scandinavia. 5G networks have standards of millimetre-band ratio spectrum to allow data to travel at speeds of one gigabit per second. 5G also reduces latency between handset and network to a few milliseconds. 5G was first offered in 2019. Modern smartphones are completely different from the mobile phone of 1973, for starters they are infinetly smaller, with users being able to use the phone with a single hand. Secondly, modern phones have many more features than calling, they are often used as a streaming device, with apps such as YouTube and Disney+ being used to watch virtually anything you can imagine. Using a smartphone, users are also given the option to send messages to others through the use of many apps and build in features. With phone companies designing and releasing new phones every year, new features are implemented quite often. Some examples of this could be the introduction of dual-lense cameras into phones, or folding screens.</ul>
