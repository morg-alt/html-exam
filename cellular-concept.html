    <h3 class="B">Cellular Concept</h3>
        <ul>Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young, who were engineers at Bell Labs, suggested hexagonal cells for mobile phones in vehicles. These cells were going to be part of a communication network where the last link was wireless. The network would be distributed over land in hexagonal cells which would each house one fixed-location tranciever, which would then provide the cell with network coverage. With all these cells combined, they could provide redio coverage throught the land. Unfortunately, at this time, the technology did not exist for this to be able to happen. In two decades, Richard H. Frekiel, Joel S Engel, and Philip T. Porter would expand on the earlier proposals in a much more detailed system plan. Porter was the one who first proposed that directional antennas would be used in cell towers to reduce interference and increase channel reuse. In this idea, there would be no continuity of service if you happened to move thtough several different cells, consumers would have to stay within the coverage area serviced by one base station throughout the call. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff were described in the late 1960s. In 1970, Amos E. Joel thought up a three-sided trunk circuit to aid in the handoff of calls. His patent had an early Bell Labs cellular concept, but it soon became unnecessary and was never fully implemented in a system. A plan for switching a cellular telephone was invented by Fluhr and Nussbaum in 1973.</ul>
