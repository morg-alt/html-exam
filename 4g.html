        <ul>With the advencement of handheld mobile phones came the advancement of phone networks 4G Native Ip networks are currently the mose widely used, but 5G networks are gradually becomming more commonplace. 4G networks were faster than 3G networks by nearly ten times. 4G networks treat voice calls like any other type of media, using packet switching through the internet. The first two commercially available 4G networks were the WiMAX standars, offered by Sprint, and the LTE standard, which was offered by TellaSonera in Scandinavia. 5G networks have standards of millimetre-band ratio spectrum to allow data to travel at speeds of one gigabit per second. 5G also reduces latency between handset and network to a few milliseconds. 5G was first offered in 2019. Modern smartphones are completely different from the mobile phone of 1973, for starters they are infinetly smaller, with users being able to use the phone with a single hand. Secondly, modern phones have many more features than calling, they are often used as a streaming device, with apps such as YouTube and Disney+ being used to watch virtually anything you can imagine. Using a smartphone, users are also given the option to send messages to others through the use of many apps and build in features. With phone companies designing and releasing new phones every year, new features are implemented quite often. Some examples of this could be the introduction of dual-lense cameras into phones, or folding screens.</ul>
