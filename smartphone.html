    <h3 class="D">The First Smartphone</h3>
        <ul>Handheld mobile phones were becoming more common, and peple were quite happy being able to make calls while on the move. In August 1994, International Buisness Machines (IBM) began distributing the IBM Simon Personal Communicator, known by most as the IBM Simon, which was the world's first smartphone. Advances in MOSFET allowed smaller integrated circuit chips, which then allowed smaller mobile phones to be developed. IBM then decided to combine a handheld mobile phone, and a PDA to create a prototype device that allowed a user to make and recieve phone calls, facsmiles, emails, and cellular pages. The prototype also had some features like a calendar, address book and notepad, maps, and stock and news software. A PDA, or Personal Digital Assistant, was a handheld device that functioned as a personal information manager. The first PDA was released in 1984 by Psion, a tech company focused on creating handheld computers. Other tech companies soon followed Psion in creating handheld computers. Soon after IBM developed their prototype, they began work on a project cond named "Angler" which integrated features from Mitsubisi Electric's wireless PDA and cellular radio technologies. When this product was finished, BellSouth executives named the device the Simon Personal Communicator. On August 16th, 1994 BellSouth released the device to consumers. With a price tag of $899 and a 15 state coverage contract, the IBM Simon sold roughly 50,000 units in a six month period.</ul>
